Hi, I need some support to help me draft files about my signature work, which is a project that shows my learning outcome and exploration during my undergraduate study. My project is called Poem into Drawings, which is a project called Verse Into Vision (VIV) which is a Tool to Visualize Ancient Chinese Poems with AI. In the project, there is couple of things that I done -Developed a comprehensive web platform that transforms ancient Chinese poetry into visual imagery using OpenAI's APIs,
including ChatGPT-3.5 and DALL-E. Engineered a system that refines image generation to accurately represent the content
and mood of each poem, allowing users to input poetry lines and receive corresponding images along with the generation
prompts. Ensured versatility and future scalability by maintaining a modular design the website, with provisions for
integrating various image generation and poetry translation models.
• Accomplished the conversion of 351 poems by Du Fu from the Complete Collection of Tang Poetry into over 1000
distinct images through advanced backend programming.
• Integrated a secondary website featuring a Tinder-like interface for user interaction, where visitors can 'Like' or 'Dislike' the
generated images, enabling the collection of data on public preferences and perceptions of the poetic imagery.
• Utilized Python's Django framework for development, with deployment executed on university virtual machines and a selfmanaged server.
